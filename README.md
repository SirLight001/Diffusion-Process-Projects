Project 1: Simulating a random walk of an agent on a square lattice with 500 walks.

Project 2: Simulating Pearsonâ€™s random walk in the plane, where the steps have constant length a = 1 and uniformly distributed random angles.

Project 3: Simulating a random walk on a Random, Watts-Strogatz, and Barabasi-Albert graph.
